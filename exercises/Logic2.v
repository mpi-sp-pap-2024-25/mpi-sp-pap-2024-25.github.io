(** ** Setoids and Logical Equivalence *)

(** Some of Coq's tactics treat [iff] statements specially, avoiding some
    low-level proof-state manipulation.  In particular, [rewrite] and
    [reflexivity] can be used with [iff] statements, not just equalities.
    To enable this behavior, we have to import the Coq library that
    supports it: *)

From Coq Require Import Setoids.Setoid.

(** A "setoid" is a set equipped with an equivalence relation -- that
    is, a relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.  When two
    elements of a set are equivalent according to the relation, [rewrite]
    can be used to replace one by the other.

    We've seen this already with the equality relation [=] in Coq: when
    [x = y], we can use [rewrite] to replace [x] with [y] or vice-versa.

    Similarly, the logical equivalence relation [<->] is reflexive,
    symmetric, and transitive, so we can use it to replace one part of a
    proposition with another: if [P <-> Q], then we can use [rewrite] to
    replace [P] with [Q], or vice-versa. *)

(** Here is a simple example demonstrating how these tactics work with
    [iff].

    First, let's prove a couple of basic iff equivalences. *)

  - intros [[H | H] | H].
    + left. apply H.
    + right. left. apply H.
    + right. right. apply H.

(** We can now use these facts with [rewrite] and [reflexivity] to
    prove a ternary version of the [mult_eq_0] fact above: *)

  forall n m p, n * m * p = 0 <-> n = 0 \/ m = 0 \/ p = 0.

(** ** Existential Quantification *)

(** Another basic logical connective is _existential quantification_.
    To say that there is some [x] of type [T] such that some property [P]
    holds of [x], we write [exists x : T, P]. As with [forall], the type
    annotation [: T] can be omitted if Coq is able to infer from the
    context what the type of [x] should be. *)

(** To prove a statement of the form [exists x, P], we must show that [P]
    holds for some specific choice for [x], known as the _witness_ of the
    existential.  This is done in two steps: First, we explicitly tell Coq
    which witness [t] we have in mind by invoking the tactic [exists t].
    Then we prove that [P] holds after all occurrences of [x] are replaced
    by [t]. *)

(** * Programming with Propositions *)

(** The logical connectives that we have seen provide a rich
    vocabulary for defining complex propositions from simpler ones.
    To illustrate, let's look at how to express the claim that an
    element [x] occurs in a list [l].  Notice that this property has a
    simple recursive structure:

       - If [l] is the empty list, then [x] cannot occur in it, so the
         property "[x] appears in [l]" is simply false.

       - Otherwise, [l] has the form [x' :: l'].  In this case, [x]
         occurs in [l] if it is equal to [x'] or if it occurs in
         [l']. *)

(** We can translate this directly into a straightforward recursive
    function taking an element and a list and returning a proposition (!): *)

Fixpoint In {A : Type} (x : A) (l : list A) : Prop :=
  match l with
  | [] => False
  | x' :: l' => x' = x \/ In x l'
  end.

(** When [In] is applied to a concrete list, it expands into a
    concrete sequence of nested disjunctions. *)

    _en passant_.) *)

(** We can also reason about more generic statements involving [In]. *)

(** (Note here how [In] starts out applied to a variable and only

(** This way of defining propositions recursively is very convenient in
    some cases, less so in others.  In particular, it is subject to Coq's
    usual restrictions regarding the definition of recursive functions,

(* ################################################################# *)
(** * Applying Theorems to Arguments *)

(** One feature that distinguishes Coq from some other popular proof
    assistants (e.g., ACL2 and Isabelle) is that it treats _proofs_ as
    first-class objects.

    There is a great deal to be said about this, but it is not necessary to
    understand it all in order to use Coq.  This section gives just a
    taste, leaving a deeper exploration for the optional chapters
    [ProofObjects] and [IndPrinciples]. *)

(** We have seen that we can use [Check] to ask Coq to check whether
    an expression has a given type: *)

Check plus : nat -> nat -> nat.
Check @rev : forall X, list X -> list X.

(** We can also use it to check the theorem a particular identifier
    refers to: *)

Check add_comm        : forall n m : nat, n + m = m + n.
Check plus_id_example : forall n m : nat, n = m -> n + n = m + m.

(** Coq checks the type of the _statements_ of the [add_comm] and
    [plus_id_example] theorems in the same way that it checks the
    _type_ of any term (e.g., plus). And if we leave off the colon and
    type, Coq will print these types for us.

    Why? *)

(** The reason is that the identifier [add_comm] actually refers to a
    _proof object_ -- a logical derivation establishing the truth of the
    statement [forall n m : nat, n + m = m + n].  The type of this object
    is the proposition that it is a proof of.

    The type of an ordinary function tells us what we can do with it.
       - If we have a term of type [nat -> nat -> nat], we can give it two
         [nat]s as arguments and get a [nat] back.

    Similarly, the statement of a theorem tells us what we can use that
    theorem for.
       - If we have a term of type [forall n m, n = m -> n + n = m + m] and we
         provide it two numbers [n] and [m] and a third "argument" of type
         [n = m], we can derive [n + n = m + m]. *)

(** Operationally, this analogy goes even further: by applying a
    theorem as if it were a function, i.e., applying it to values and
    hypotheses with matching types, we can specialize its result
    without having to resort to intermediate assertions.  For example,
    suppose we wanted to prove the following result: *)

Lemma add_comm3 :
  forall x y z, x + (y + z) = (z + y) + x.

(** It appears at first sight that we ought to be able to prove this by
    rewriting with [add_comm] twice to make the two sides match.  The
    problem is that the second [rewrite] will undo the effect of the
    first. *)

Proof.
  intros x y z.
  rewrite add_comm.
  rewrite add_comm.
  (* We are back where we started... *)
Abort.

(** We encountered similar issues back in [Induction], and we saw
    one way to work around them by using [assert] to derive a specialized
    version of [add_comm] that can be used to rewrite exactly where we
    want. *)

Lemma add_comm3_take2 :
  forall x y z, x + (y + z) = (z + y) + x.
Proof.
  intros x y z.
  rewrite add_comm.
  assert (H : y + z = z + y).
    { rewrite add_comm. reflexivity. }
  rewrite H.
  reflexivity.
Qed.

(** A more elegant alternative is to apply [add_comm] directly
    to the arguments we want to instantiate it with, in much the same
    way as we apply a polymorphic function to a type argument. *)

Lemma add_comm3_take3 :
  forall x y z, x + (y + z) = (z + y) + x.
Proof.
  intros x y z.
  rewrite add_comm.
  rewrite (add_comm y z).
  reflexivity.

(** If we really wanted, we could in fact do it for both rewrites. *)

Lemma add_comm3_take4 :

Proof.
  intros x y z.
  rewrite (add_comm x (y + z)).
  rewrite (add_comm y z).
  reflexivity.
Qed.

(** Here's another example of using a trivial theorem about lists like
    a function.

    The theorem says: if a list [l] contains some
    element [x], then [l] must be nonempty. *)

Theorem in_not_nil :
  forall A (x : A) (l : list A), In x l -> l <> [].
Proof.
  intros A x l H. unfold not. intro Hl.
  rewrite Hl in H.
  simpl in H.
  apply H.
Qed.

(** What makes this interesting is that one quantified variable
    ([x]) does not appear in the conclusion ([l <> []]). *)

(** Intuitively, we should be able to use this theorem to prove the special
    case where [x] is [42]. However, simply invoking the tactic [apply
    in_not_nil] will fail because it cannot infer the value of [x]. *)

Lemma in_not_nil_42 :
  forall l : list nat, In 42 l -> l <> [].

Proof.
  intros l H.
  apply in_not_nil with (x := 42).

Proof.
  intros l H.

(** You can "use a theorem as a function" in this way with almost any
    tactic that can take a theorem's name as an argument.

    Note, also, that theorem application uses the same inference
    mechanisms as function application; thus, it is possible, for
    example, to supply wildcards as arguments to be inferred, or to
    declare some hypotheses to a theorem as implicit by default.
    These features are illustrated in the proof below. (The details of
    how this proof works are not critical -- the goal here is just to
    illustrate applying theorems to arguments.) *)

(** * Working with Decidable Properties *)

(** We've seen two different ways of expressing logical claims in Coq:
    with _booleans_ (of type [bool]), and with _propositions_ (of type
    [Prop]).

    Here are the key differences between [bool] and [Prop]:

                                           bool     Prop
                                           ====     ====
           decidable?                      yes       no
           useable with match?             yes       no
           works with rewrite tactic?      no        yes
*)

(** The crucial difference between the two worlds is _decidability_.
    Every (closed) Coq expression of type [bool] can be simplified in a
    finite number of steps to either [true] or [false] -- i.e., there is a
    terminating mechanical procedure for deciding whether or not it is
    [true].

    This means that, for example, the type [nat -> bool] is inhabited only
    by functions that, given a [nat], always yield either [true] or [false]
    in finite time; and this, in turn, means (by a standard computability
    argument) that there is _no_ function in [nat -> bool] that checks
    whether a given number is the code of a terminating Turing machine.

    By contrast, the type [Prop] includes both decidable and undecidable
    mathematical propositions; in particular, the type [nat -> Prop] does
    contain functions representing properties like "the nth Turing machine
    halts."

    The second row in the table follows directly from this essential
    difference.  To evaluate a pattern match (or conditional) on a boolean,
    we need to know whether the scrutinee evaluates to [true] or [false];
    this only works for [bool], not [Prop].

    The third row highlights another important practical difference:
    equality functions like [eqb_nat] that return a boolean cannot be used
    directly to justify rewriting with the [rewrite] tactic; propositional
    equality is required for this. *)


(** Since [Prop] includes _both_ decidable and undecidable properties, we
    have two options when we want to formalize a property that happens to
    be decidable: we can express it either as a boolean computation or as a
    function into [Prop]. *)

Example even_42_bool : even 42 = true.
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

(** ... or that there exists some [k] such that [n = double k]. *)

(** Of course, it would be pretty strange if these two
    characterizations of evenness did not describe the same set of
    natural numbers!  Fortunately, we can prove that they do... *)

(** We first need two helper lemmas. *)
Lemma even_double : forall k, even (double k) = true.

  - simpl. apply IHk'.

  n = if even n then double k else S (double k).

Qed.

(** In view of this theorem, we can say that the boolean computation
    [even n] is _reflected_ in the truth of the proposition
    [exists k, n = double k]. *)

(** Similarly, to state that two numbers [n] and [m] are equal, we can
    say either
      - (1) that [n =? m] returns [true], or
      - (2) that [n = m].
    Again, these two notions are equivalent: *)

Theorem eqb_eq : forall n1 n2 : nat,
  n1 =? n2 = true <-> n1 = n2.
Proof.
  intros n1 n2. split.
  - apply eqb_true.
  - intros H. rewrite H. rewrite eqb_refl. reflexivity.
Qed.

(** Even when the boolean and propositional formulations of a claim are
    interchangeable from a purely logical perspective, it can be more
    convenient to use one over the other. *)

(** For example, there is no effective way to _test_ whether or not a
    [Prop] is true in a function definition; thus the
    following definition is rejected: *)

Fail
Definition is_even_prime n :=
  if n = 2 then true
  else false.

(** Coq complains that [n = 2] has type [Prop], while it expects an
    element of [bool] (or some other inductive type with two constructors).
    This has to do with the _computational_ nature of Coq's core language,
    which is designed so that every function it can express is computable
    and total.  One reason for this is to allow the extraction of
    executable programs from Coq developments.  As a consequence, [Prop] in
    Coq does _not_ have a universal case analysis operation telling whether
    any given proposition is true or false, since such an operation would
    allow us to write non-computable functions.  *)

(** Rather, we have to state this definition using a boolean equality
    test. *)

Definition is_even_prime n :=
  if n =? 2 then true
  else false.

(** Beyond the fact that non-computable properties are impossible in
    general to phrase as boolean computations, even many _computable_
    properties are easier to express using [Prop] than [bool], since
    recursive function definitions in Coq are subject to significant
    restrictions.  For instance, the next chapter shows how to define the
    property that a regular expression matches a given string using [Prop].
    Doing the same with [bool] would amount to writing a regular expression
    matching algorithm, which would be more complicated, harder to
    understand, and harder to reason about than a simple (non-algorithmic)
    definition of this property.

    Conversely, an important side benefit of stating facts using booleans
    is enabling some proof automation through computation with Coq terms, a
    technique known as _proof by reflection_.

    Consider the following statement: *)

Example even_1000 : Even 1000.

(** The most direct way to prove this is to give the value of [k]
    explicitly. *)

Proof. unfold Even. exists 500. reflexivity. Qed.

(** The proof of the corresponding boolean statement is simpler, because we
    don't have to invent the witness [500]: Coq's computation mechanism
    does it for us! *)

Example even_1000' : even 1000 = true.
Proof. reflexivity. Qed.

(** Now, the useful observation is that, since the two notions are
    equivalent, we can use the boolean formulation to prove the other one
    without mentioning the value 500 explicitly: *)

Example even_1000'' : Even 1000.
Proof. apply even_bool_prop. reflexivity. Qed.

(** Although we haven't gained much in terms of proof-script
    line count in this case, larger proofs can often be made considerably
    simpler by the use of reflection.  As an extreme example, a famous
    Coq proof of the even more famous _4-color theorem_ uses
    reflection to reduce the analysis of hundreds of different cases
    to a boolean computation. *)

(** Another advantage of booleans is that the negation of a "boolean fact"
    is straightforward to state and prove: simply flip the expected boolean
    result. *)

Example not_even_1001 : even 1001 = false.
Proof.
  reflexivity.
Qed.

(** In contrast, propositional negation can be difficult to work with
    directly.

    For example, suppose we state the non-evenness of [1001]
    propositionally: *)

Example not_even_1001' : ~(Even 1001).

(** Proving this directly -- by assuming that there is some [n] such that
    [1001 = double n] and then somehow reasoning to a contradiction --
    would be rather complicated.

    But if we convert it to a claim about the boolean [even] function, we
    can let Coq do the work for us. *)

Proof.
  (* WORKED IN CLASS *)
  rewrite <- even_bool_prop.
  unfold not.
  simpl.
  intro H.
  discriminate H.
Qed.

(** Conversely, there are complementary situations where it can be easier
    to work with propositions rather than booleans.

    In particular, knowing that [(n =? m) = true] is generally of little
    direct help in the middle of a proof involving [n] and [m], but if we
    convert the statement to the equivalent form [n = m], we can rewrite
    with it. *)

Lemma plus_eqb_example : forall n m p : nat,
  n =? m = true -> n + p =? m + p = true.
Proof.
  (* WORKED IN CLASS *)
  intros n m p H.
  rewrite eqb_eq in H.
  rewrite H.
  rewrite eqb_eq.
  reflexivity.
Qed.

(** We won't discuss reflection any further for the moment, but
    it serves as a good example showing the different strengths of
    booleans and general propositions.

    Being able to cross back and forth between the boolean and
    propositional worlds will often be convenient in later chapters. *)
